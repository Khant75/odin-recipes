        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Regarded as Myanmar’s national dish and prolific across the country, mohinga is a fish soup made with rice noodles. The exact recipe varies based on regional tastes and ingredients, but you’ll find a typical version in the country’s south, where fresh fish abounds.To form the rich and hardy broth, vendors combine chickpea flour with a host of vegetables and seasoning, including onions, lemongrass, garlic, ginger and banana tree stem, then cook it in fish sauce. After combining the stew with rice vermicelli, the dish can be topped with an array of optional additions,
            including crispy fritters, chickpeas or a boiled egg—meaning each bowl of mohinga, like each individual experience in Myanmar, is completely unique.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>10 ounces fine round rice noodles</li>
            <li>6 hard-boiled eggs</li>
            <li>12 Yellow Split Pea Crackers</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
            <li>2 limes</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced red onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 350°F. Spread the rice across a rimmed baking pan and bake, giving the pan an occasional stir, until the rice is an even golden color and aromatic, 20 minutes. Cool to room temperature and then pulverize in a clean coffee grinder.</li>
            <li>To make the broth, select a large wide pot that will fit the catfish comfortably with room to spare. (An 8-quart pot works well.) Add the water, lemongrass, ginger, bay leaves, black and white pepper, and salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower the fish into the pot. The fish may not be completely covered in water, but that’s okay. Bring the pot to a brisk simmer, lower the heat, and cook gently for 15 minutes. Using tongs, carefully turn the fish over or at least rotate it slightly to cook the side that was sticking out of the water. Simmer for another 5 minutes or until the fish flesh pulls away cleanly from the bone. Using tongs and a spider or slotted spoon, lift the fish out of the broth and transfer to a bowl. Turn off the heat and let the broth sit on the stove.</li>
            <li>When the fish is cool enough to handle, pull off the skin and discard. Separate the cooked fish from the bones, trying to keep the skeleton (or skeleton portions if the fish is cut in pieces) intact. Set aside the cooked fish. Return the skeleton (including head and tail) to the pot.</li>
            <li>Bring the pot to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 15 minutes. The broth should have a mild ginger-lemongrass flavor and be slightly cloudy. Strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer. You will have about 10 cups. Give the pot a quick rinse (when it’s cool enough to handle), and return the broth to the pot.</li>
        </ol>
